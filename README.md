#**Aditya Mogadpally**

I am a Product Management and Business Analysis enthusiast with a strong foundation in project management, data analytics, and software engineering. My experience spans across multiple industries, from pharmaceuticals to supply chain and fintech, where I have successfully led data-driven initiatives, optimized reporting systems, and enhanced decision-making processes.

I have worked at Johnson & Johnson as a Business Analyst, where I streamlined reporting using Lean Six Sigma and Power BI, reducing report processing time and improving data visualization. Additionally, I gained experience in project coordination and portfolio management at Alexion Pharmaceuticals and am currently contributing to sustainability-driven technology initiatives at Greenstand.

My technical expertise includes Power BI, SQL, Excel, and Python, allowing me to analyze complex datasets and develop actionable insights. Beyond analytics, I have a background in software engineering, having developed scalable applications and database solutions. During my tenure at Musafir.com, I resolved backend and data-related issues, enhancing operational efficiency.

I am passionate about leveraging data, technology, and business strategy to drive impactful product decisions. My future goal is to work at the intersection of technology and business, shaping innovative solutions that enhance user experience and efficiency. My academic journey at Northeastern University and Lean Six Sigma certification have further strengthened my approach to structured problem-solving and continuous improvement.

Outside of work, I am an avid guitarist, a fitness enthusiast engaged in weight training, and someone who enjoys traveling and exploring nature. I also have a deep appreciation for community-driven initiatives, which is reflected in my past work on Tandem, a platform aimed at connecting people with various services.

I am excited about collaborating on innovative projects and discussing opportunities in product management, business analysis, and data-driven decision-making. Feel free to connect with me!
